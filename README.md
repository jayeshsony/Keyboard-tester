# Keyboard Tester

A simple web-based tool to test whether the keys on your keyboard are functioning properly. This project utilizes HTML, CSS, and JavaScript to create an interactive interface where users can press keys on their keyboard and see visual feedback indicating whether the key press is registered.

## Features

- **Interactive Testing**: Users can press any key on their keyboard, and the corresponding key on the virtual keyboard will change color to indicate that the key press is detected.
- **Visual Feedback**: Instant visual feedback helps users quickly identify if a particular key is working or not.
